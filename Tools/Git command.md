When you’re ready to save a copy of the current state of the project, you stage changes with `git add`. After you’re happy with the staged snapshot, you commit it to the project history with `git commit`. The `git reset` command is used to undo a commit or staged snapshot.

    `git add .`

4. git pull fast-forward    
    
    `git pull --ff-only origin`
